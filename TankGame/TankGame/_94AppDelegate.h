/*
 Good job - you made it! You got all the requirements done and created an app
 that's fun to play. The only glitch I noticed is that the AI still tries to aim
 the cannon when it's in two-player mode, leading to a battle over the direction
 of player 2's fire. But that's a pretty small thing. You should be proud of
 finishing it, and vow hereafter not to discount how much work goes into mobile
 software development.
